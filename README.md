# Depression-prediction
This is a Logistic regression model that predicts who is suffering from depression given some features.

# Intro
The World Health Organization estimates that 1.3 million Kenyans suffer from untreated major depressive disorder (MDD; commonly known as depression) every year, and that sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of the illness of any region in the world. Yet mental health treatment in Kenya suffers from a lack of resources and stigmatization. There are only two certified psychiatrists per million people in Kenya. Few facilities exist outside of urban areas and people are unlikely to know about or access them.

Can machine learning help alleviate this problem? Smart targeting of potential cases could help enable scarce resources to reach those who most need it and improve or save an untold number of lives.


# Data
These data come from a 2015 study conducted by the Busara Center in rural Siaya County, near Lake Victoria in western Kenya. The survey includes more than 70 features, including information about household composition, economic activity, financial flows and health. In addition, study participants were asked to complete a depression screening tool. This data are hard to collect en masse, due to the sensitive content, and need for trained staff and referral procedures.

The data has been split into a test and training set.

train.csv is the dataset that you will use to train your model.

test.csv is the dataset to which you will apply your model to test how well it performs. Use your model and this dataset to predict depression.
